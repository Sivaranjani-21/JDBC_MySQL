# JDBC_MySQL

Java JDBC Application with MySQL Database


Description
This is a simple Java JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using a MySQL database. It serves as a template for building Java applications that interact with databases, allowing you to quickly set up database connections and perform common database operations.

The application showcases how to connect to a MySQL database, add records to tables, retrieve records, and update records. It can be used as a foundation for more complex projects that require database interactions.

Features
Java application structure with database connectivity using JDBC
Integration with a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval
Demonstrates basic CRUD operations on sample tables
Customizable for adding more tables, entities, and functionality


Usage
The application provides a simple command-line interface for performing database operations.
You can customize the application by adding your own tables, entities, and JDBC operations.
Ensure that the MySQL JDBC driver is included in your project's dependencies for database connectivity.
